Section 1. Introduction
-----------------------

For our final project, we wanted to analyze the number of sexual partners college students, primarily those at Duke, have had and whether or not that number correlates to a range of demographic factors, such as religion, year in school, or political views. We collected our own data for this project using a Qualtrics survey. This survey was relatively short and had 14 questions, and the results of these questions are stored in the variables below:

1.  student: Are you a college student?
2.  college: Which college do you go to?
3.  year: Which year in college are you?
4.  age: What is your age?
5.  gender: What is your gender?
6.  major: What is your major?
7.  athlete: Are you a student athlete?
8.  greek: Are you involved in a fraternity or sorority?
9.  politics: How would you describe your political views? (There were 5 options for this question: Very Conservative, Somewhat Conservative, Neither, Somewhat Liberal, and Very Liberal)
10. religious: Would you consider yourself to be religious?
11. religion: If so, which religion do you practice?
12. partners: In your life, how many sexual partners have you had?
13. partners\_college: Since coming to college, how many sexual partners have you had?
14. relationship: Are you currently in a committed romantic relationship that has lasted longer than 1 month?

To get answers to our survey, we asked our friends to fill it out and also posted the survey in the All Duke Facebook group and the class Slack channel. We received 396 responses to our survey in less than 2 days. Because our survey was voluntary and taken primarily by Duke students and people we know, we are aware that our data may be skewed and not necessarily super accurate. In other words, our data is definitely subject to voluntary response bias. We are also aware that, by the nature of the questions asked in our survey, we may have gotten some bogus responses (which should be fairly easy to identify and remove from our analysis). However, we hope to still be able to find some interesting trends within our data, and to find a relationship(s) between the number of sexual partners for college students and another one of our variables.
